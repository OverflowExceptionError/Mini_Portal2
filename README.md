# Mini Source FilmMaker / Portal 2

Hello! This project is based on:

The Stanley Parable Demo (it's free!!!)

The leaked Portal 2 SFM

As a result, I've stated in the description that basically everything, with the exception of some Stanley Parable stuff, belongs to Valve.

I'm gonna make it smaller, it's too big.

600MB is a bit big for my taste personally.

I'm used to making Source 100MB or less.
